# Interactive-Dashboard-on-Airline-Sentiment

This is an interactive data dashboard built with the Streamlit library in Python. It can be accessed as a web app and run locally. I analyzed the sentiments of US airline tweets based on the data obtained from Kaggle [here](https://www.kaggle.com/crowdflower/twitter-airline-sentiment). 

### Usage

Requirements
1. streamlit
2. plotly express
3. wordcloud

Make sure that the data_url variable is changed to match the location of the data.

Instructions about how to run a streamlit app can be found [here](https://docs.streamlit.io/en/stable/cli.html)
